<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>The overarching question of our group project was: <strong>“How do county, income, and demographics affect mortgage loans and rates across the three stages of the COVID-19 pandemic?”</strong> The project analyzed shifts in mortgages before, during, and after the pandemic (2018-2023) using metrics related to geography, demographics, and economics. Our group explored patterns in income, employment, and loan distribution, uncovering trends in equity, race, and economic behavior.</p>
<p>In my individual report, I aim to address <strong>specific financial questions</strong> derived from this overarching question. These include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>How did loan applications and approval rates vary across the Pre-Pandemic, Pandemic, and Post-Pandemic periods?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are people with higher incomes more likely to secure lower mortgage rates during the pandemic? Does income level significantly impact mortgage rates during the pandemic?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do certain job types in a county influence mortgage rates during the pandemic?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Through targeted analyses and statistical tests, I will provide insights into these financial dimensions and their implications within the context of the broader group findings.</p>

<p>The plot shows that post-pandemic, loan applications decreased to levels lower than pre-pandemic. During the pandemic, applications significantly increased, likely due to lower interest rates, while approval rates remained consistent across all three periods.</p>

<p>The graph shows that before the pandemic, high-income earners had slightly lower loan rates compared to other income groups, with lower-middle-income earners facing the highest rates. During the pandemic, rates dropped for all groups and became almost equal. Post-pandemic, rates for high, upper-middle, and low-income groups equalized, while lower-middle-income earners faced higher rates. Interestingly, post-pandemic rates remain lower than pre-pandemic rates when comparing the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 periods.</p>
<p>Let’s create another plot to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between mortgage rates and income levels across the three time periods.</p>

<p>This plot highlights that mortgage rates were uneven before and after the pandemic. However, during the pandemic, the rates decreased for all income levels and became more consistent. Despite this, the rate for the High-Income group remained slightly lower compared to other income groups. Before the pandemic, the High-Income group enjoyed the lowest loan rates. After the pandemic, this is no longer the case, as the rates for this group are no longer the lowest.</p>
<p>Let’s perform a series of statistical tests to validate the insights drawn from the plots.</p>

<p><strong>Results of Statistical Tests on Interest Rates by Income Groups (2020-2021):</strong> Test 1: High Income vs.&nbsp;Low Income (COVID 2020-2021) - <strong>t-statistic</strong>: -90.937<br>
- <strong>p-value</strong>: &lt; 2.2e-16<br>
- <strong>95% Confidence Interval</strong>: [-0.28473, -0.27215]<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (High Income)</strong>: 3.13<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (Low Income)</strong>: 3.41</p>
<p>Interpretation The p-value is significantly below the 0.05 threshold, indicating a statistically significant difference in interest rates between high-income and low-income groups during the pandemic. The confidence interval does not include zero, confirming this difference. Low-income earners had higher interest rates than high-income earners.</p>
<hr>
<p>Test 2: High Income vs.&nbsp;Low &amp; Lower-Middle Income (Combined) (COVID 2020-2021) - <strong>t-statistic</strong>: -62.402<br>
- <strong>p-value</strong>: &lt; 2.2e-16<br>
- <strong>95% Confidence Interval</strong>: [-0.12824, -0.12043]<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (High Income)</strong>: 3.13<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (Low &amp; Lower-Middle Income)</strong>: 3.25</p>
<p>Interpretation Similarly, this test shows a statistically significant difference, with a p-value far below 0.05 and a confidence interval excluding zero. The combined group of low- and lower-middle-income earners had higher interest rates than high-income earners.</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Are people with higher incomes more likely to get lower mortgage rates during the pandemic?<br>
<strong>Yes</strong>, high-income earners were more likely to secure lower mortgage rates during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Do higher incomes affect mortgage rates during the pandemic?<br>
<strong>Yes</strong>, income level significantly affected mortgage rates, with higher-income groups benefiting from lower interest rates compared to lower-income groups.</p>
<p>Let’s perform the same test for the pre-pandemic period.</p>

<p><strong>Results of Statistical Tests on Interest Rates by Income Groups (2018-2019):</strong></p>
<p>Test 1: High Income vs.&nbsp;Low Income - <strong>t-statistic</strong>: -3.1033<br>
- <strong>p-value</strong>: 0.001914<br>
- <strong>95% Confidence Interval</strong>: [-0.343, -0.077]<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (High Income)</strong>: 4.55<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (Low Income)</strong>: 4.76</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br>
The p-value (0.001914) is below the significance level of 0.05, indicating a statistically significant difference in interest rates between high-income and low-income groups before the pandemic. The confidence interval does not include zero, confirming this difference. Low-income earners had higher interest rates than high-income earners.</p>
<hr>
<p>Test 2: High Income vs.&nbsp;Low &amp; Lower-Middle Income (Combined) - <strong>t-statistic</strong>: -2.6279<br>
- <strong>p-value</strong>: 0.008591<br>
- <strong>95% Confidence Interval</strong>: [-0.311, -0.045]<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (High Income)</strong>: 4.55<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (Low &amp; Lower-Middle Income)</strong>: 4.72</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br>
Similarly, this test shows a statistically significant difference, with a p-value (0.008591) below 0.05. The confidence interval excludes zero, confirming the finding. The combined group of low- and lower-middle-income earners had higher interest rates compared to high-income earners.</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion <strong>Are people with higher incomes more likely to get lower mortgage rates before the pandemic?</strong><br>
Yes, high-income earners were more likely to secure lower mortgage rates before the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Do higher incomes affect mortgage rates before the pandemic?</strong><br>
Yes, income level significantly affected mortgage rates, with higher-income groups benefiting from lower interest rates compared to lower-income groups.</p>
<p>Let’s perform the same test for the post-pandemic period.</p>

- <strong>p-value</strong>: &lt; 2.2e-16<br>
- <strong>95% Confidence Interval</strong>: [0.812, 0.850]<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (High Income)</strong>: 5.54<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (Low Income)</strong>: 4.71</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br>
The p-value (&lt; 2.2e-16) is significantly below the 0.05 threshold, indicating a statistically significant difference in interest rates between high-income and low-income groups after the pandemic. The confidence interval does not include zero, confirming this difference. High-income earners had higher interest rates than low-income earners.</p>
<hr>
<p>Test 2: High Income vs.&nbsp;Low &amp; Lower-Middle Income (Combined) - <strong>t-statistic</strong>: 11.123<br>
- <strong>p-value</strong>: &lt; 2.2e-16<br>
- <strong>95% Confidence Interval</strong>: [0.077, 0.110]<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (High Income)</strong>: 5.54<br>
- <strong>Mean Interest Rate (Low &amp; Lower-Middle Income)</strong>: 5.45</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br>
Similarly, this test reveals a statistically significant difference, with a p-value (&lt; 2.2e-16) below 0.05. The confidence interval excludes zero, confirming the finding. High-income earners had slightly higher interest rates compared to the combined low- and lower-middle-income groups after the pandemic.</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion <strong>Are people with higher incomes more likely to get lower mortgage rates after the pandemic?</strong><br>
No, high-income earners had higher mortgage rates compared to low-income earners after the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Do higher incomes affect mortgage rates after the pandemic?</strong><br>
Yes, income level significantly affected mortgage rates, but higher-income groups faced slightly higher interest rates compared to lower-income groups.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Interest Rates Between High and Low Income Groups (Pre, During, and Post-COVID):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-COVID (2018-2019)</strong>: High-income earners had significantly lower mortgage rates compared to low-income groups.</li>
<li><strong>During COVID (2020-2021)</strong>: High-income earners continued to secure slightly lower rates compared to low-income groups, but the differences were less pronounced.</li>
<li><strong>Post-COVID (2022-2023)</strong>: Interestingly, high-income earners faced <strong>higher mortgage rates</strong> compared to low-income groups, reversing the trend observed pre-COVID.</li>
</ul>
<p>These results indicate that the relationship between income level and interest rates shifted over time, suggesting that external factors during the post-pandemic period might have influenced rate determination beyond income level alone.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-next-specific-question-we-are-going-to-anawer-is-do-certain-jobs-in-a-county-affect-mortgage-rates-during-the-pandemic">The next specific question we are going to anawer is <strong>Do certain jobs in a county affect mortgage rates during the pandemic?</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s prepare the <code>merged_data</code> table to address the question. It will include the <code>location</code> variable listing all counties in New York State, the <code>job_type</code> variable with five job group categories, the <code>time_period</code> column representing the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases, the <code>avg_population</code> column showing the number of workers in the five job groups, and the <code>avg_loan_rate</code> column for each county.</p>

<p>The plot reveals that the “Management, Business, Science, Arts” job group constitutes the largest portion of employment in New York State. The average loan rates are comparable between NYC and the Rest of State. Additionally, loan rates significantly declined during the pandemic but rose post-pandemic to levels higher than those observed before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Next, let’s create a similar plot to compare the five boroughs of NYC.</p>

<p>The plot shows a significant drop in employment numbers during the pandemic, with post-pandemic levels not yet fully recovering to pre-pandemic figures. Additionally, the proportion of “Management, Business, Science, Arts” jobs is highest in Brooklyn and Manhattan, which also have lower loan rates compared to the other three boroughs.</p>
<p>Let’s validate our observations from the plot through statistical tests. First, we will prepare the data table required for these tests.</p>

<p>The ANOVA test was conducted to determine if the <strong>proportion of job types</strong> (independent variable) affects the <strong>average loan rate</strong> (dependent variable) at the county level in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> Job type proportions have no effect on average loan rates.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> - F-value: 0<br>
- p-value: 1</p>
<p>The results indicate that job type proportions do not explain any variation in the average loan rate. The analysis suggests that <strong>job type proportions do not influence the average loan rate</strong> in the dataset.</p>
<p>Based on the ANOVA test, which included all job groups and counties in New York State, no relationship was found between the proportion of job types and the average loan rate in the state.</p>
<p>Now, let’s proceed with a Correlation test.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis of Job Type Proportions and Average Loan Rates:</strong></p>
<p>Observations from Scatter Plots: 1. <strong>“Management, Business, Science, Arts”</strong>: - Displays a negative slope. - Suggests that counties with a higher proportion of this job type tend to have lower average loan rates.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>“Sales and Office”</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Shows a near-zero slope.</li>
<li>Indicates no clear relationship between the proportion of these jobs and average loan rates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>“Production, Transportation, Material Moving”</strong>, <strong>“Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance”</strong>, and <strong>“Service”</strong>:
<ul>
<li>All exhibit positive slopes.</li>
<li>Suggest that higher proportions of these job types are associated with slightly higher average loan rates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Correlation Test Results: - <strong>Correlation value</strong>: ~0 (close to zero). - <strong>p-value</strong>: 1. - Interpretation: - The correlation test indicates <strong>no statistically significant linear relationship</strong> between job type proportions and average loan rates across all job types.</p>
<p>Conclusion: While visual differences in slopes are observed for individual job types, the overall correlation result suggests that these differences are not statistically significant. This implies that the proportions of job types may not strongly influence average loan rates in a linear manner.</p>
<p>Now, let’s perform the same test for the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods to determine whether the relationship between job types and loan rates remained consistent before and after the pandemic.</p>

<p>The linear regression analysis explores the relationship between the proportion of <strong>“Management, Business, Science, Arts”</strong> jobs and the average loan rate during the year 2021.</p>
<p>Results: - <strong>Coefficient</strong>: A unit increase in the proportion of <strong>“Management, Business, Science, Arts”</strong> jobs reduces the average loan rate by <strong>1.95</strong>. - <strong>Significance</strong>: The p-value (<strong>1.38e-05</strong>) indicates the result is statistically significant. - <strong>R-squared</strong>: The model explains <strong>42.16%</strong> of the variability in loan rates.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Based on the significant negative relationship between the proportion of <strong>“Management, Business, Science, Arts”</strong> jobs and average loan rates, we can conclude that <strong>certain jobs in a county influence mortgage rates during the pandemic</strong>. In particular, higher proportions of this job type are associated with <strong>lower mortgage rates</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s perform the same analysis for the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods.</p>

<p>A similar result was obtained for the pre- and post-COVID years in the regression analysis for the “Management, Business, Science, Arts” job category, indicating that the relationship between this job group and the average loan rate remained consistent before, during, and after the pandemic.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s perform a multiple regression analysis to examine the relationship between the average loan rate in New York State during the pandemic and two specific job categories: “Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance” and “Production, Transportation, Material Moving.”</p>

<p>Regression Analysis Results: Impact of Job Type Proportions on Loan Rates</p>
<p>The multiple regression analysis examines the relationship between the proportions of specific job types and the average loan rate for the year 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance</strong>: - Significance: The p-value (<strong>0.0291</strong>) is below 0.05, indicating a statistically significant effect.</p>
<p><strong>Production, Transportation, Material Moving</strong>: - Significance: The p-value (<strong>0.0161</strong>) is below 0.05, confirming a statistically significant effect.</p>
<p><strong>Model Performance</strong> - <strong>R-squared</strong>: <strong>50.2%</strong> of the variability in loan rates is explained by the model.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> The analysis indicates that higher proportions of <strong>Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance</strong> and <strong>Production, Transportation, Material Moving</strong> jobs are associated with increased loan rates. These results suggest that job type proportions within counties influence average loan rates during 2021.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The overarching question of our group project was: <em>“How do county, income, and demographics affect mortgage loans and rates across the three stages of the COVID-19 pandemic?”</em> Through my individual analysis, I addressed financial-specific questions that reveal patterns within this broader inquiry:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Loan Applications and Approval Rates Across Time Periods</strong><br>
Loan applications significantly increased during the pandemic, driven by historically low interest rates, but approval rates remained consistent. Post-pandemic, loan applications decreased, and approval rates returned to pre-pandemic patterns. This indicates a temporary shift in behavior during the pandemic but a return to prior trends afterward.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact of Income Levels on Mortgage Rates During the Pandemic</strong><br>
Higher-income earners consistently secured lower mortgage rates during the pandemic, demonstrating that income level significantly influenced loan rates. This trend persisted before and after the pandemic, although post-pandemic rates for high-income groups were no longer the lowest, signaling a shift in the relationship between income and loan rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Job Types and Their Influence on Mortgage Rates During the Pandemic</strong><br>
While the ANOVA test suggested no direct influence of job types on loan rates at the state level, further analysis revealed that certain job categories, such as <em>Management, Business, Science, Arts</em>, had a statistically significant impact on lowering mortgage rates. Conversely, job categories like <em>Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance</em> and <em>Production, Transportation, Material Moving</em> were associated with higher loan rates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The findings align closely with the group project’s primary focus on how economic and demographic variables influenced mortgage dynamics. By examining loan trends across time, the role of income in securing favorable rates, and the nuanced impact of employment type, this analysis adds depth to understanding the interplay between financial patterns and broader socio-economic shifts during and beyond the pandemic.</p>
