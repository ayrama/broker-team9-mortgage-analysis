What could explain this?\nWhat loan types were most popular pre, during, and post-pandemic?\nBased on race and sex, who took out the most and least loans? Were specific loans dominant?\nIs there a skew in the total number of loans given out depending on the county or geographic area?\nDo interest rates vary significantly by county, and how are they influenced by sex or race?\n\n\n\nData Sources\n\nNYC Annualized Sales (2003-2023)\nSource: NYC Department of Finance\nDescription: Provides property sales data for NYC.\nRecord Mortgages Originated NY (2016-2021)\nSource: NY State Department of Financial Services\nDescription: Contains records of mortgages originated in New York State.\nHMDA US Mortgage Data (5 Years)\nSource: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\nDescription: Loan-level mortgage data, including interest rates, loan terms, and loan types.\nS1901: Income in the Past 12 Months\nSource: US Census Bureau\nDescription: Annual income data by household type and income brackets.\nS2401: Occupation by Sex for the Civilian Employed Population 16 Years and Over\nSource: US Census Bureau\nDescription: Employment statistics by occupation and demographics.\n\n\n\nProject Goals\n\nExamine the relationship between income, geographic location, and mortgage trends.\nAnalyze demographic factors (race, sex) influencing mortgage patterns.\nStudy the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortgage rates and types.\n\n\n\nTeam Members\n\nMaria Jerez\nLauren Cardieri\nAyrat Aymetov\n\n\n\nFolder Structure\n\n/data: Contains raw and cleaned datasets.\n/scripts: Includes code for data analysis and visualization.\n/docs: Documentation related to the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York shapefile\n\nDownloading New York shape file\n\n\nCode\nbase_url &lt;- \"https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2024/CD/\"\nfile_name &lt;- paste0(\"tl_2024_36_cd119.zip\")\nfile_url &lt;- paste0(base_url, file_name)\ndest_file &lt;- file.path(\"data\", file_name)  # Save in the /data folder\n\n# Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist\ndir.create(\"data\", showWarnings = FALSE)\n\n# Download the file\ntryCatch({\n  download.file(file_url, destfile = dest_file, mode = \"wb\")\n  message(\"Downloaded file: \", file_name, \" to data folder\")\n}, error = function(e) {\n  message(\"Failed to download file: \", file_name, \" - Error: \", e$message)\n})\n\n\n\n\nopening New York shapefile\n\n\nCode\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(utils)\n\n# Define the path to the ZIP file and extraction directory\nzip_file &lt;- \"data/tl_2024_36_cd119.zip\"\nextract_dir &lt;- \"data/tl_2024_36_cd119\"\n\n# Unzip the file\nunzip(zipfile = zip_file, exdir = extract_dir)\n\n# Load the shapefile (adjust path as needed)\nshapefile_path &lt;- file.path(extract_dir, \"tl_2024_36_cd119.shp\")\nshapefile &lt;- st_read(shapefile_path, quiet = TRUE)\n\n# Plot the map\nplot(st_geometry(shapefile))"
